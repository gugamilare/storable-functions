# Storable Functions
==================

## Warning: deprecated

This library is buggy and deprecated. It turns out it is easier and better to create a serializer from scratch than providing extensions for other libraries on this matter. I've been working on a library that transforms objects (including functions) into a source code that creates a fresh copy of them.


## About

Storable Functions aims to provide a simple and portable way to serialize functions.
